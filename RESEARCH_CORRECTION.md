# RESEARCH STATUS UPDATE - Bespoke Token Dimensions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CORRECTION

**Previous Claims**: We initially reported up to "24x better performance" for bespoke token dimensions.

**Actual Results**: After proper validation with adequate training epochs, bespoke embeddings show:
- **Performance**: 0.6% worse than standard embeddings
- **Parameters**: 2.48x more parameters  
- **Efficiency**: No demonstrated benefit

## üî¨ Scientific Integrity Update

### What Went Wrong
1. **Inadequate Training**: Initial tests used only 3 epochs
2. **Synthetic Tasks**: Oversimplified prediction tasks
3. **Premature Conclusions**: Declared success without proper convergence

### What We Actually Measured
- **50 epochs** of proper training
- **Next-token prediction** on Zipfian-distributed corpus
- **Proper convergence** - both models learned successfully
- **Honest comparison** after full training cycles

### Current Evidence
```
Standard Model:  2.9091 final loss
Bespoke Model:   2.9251 final loss  
Difference:      -0.6% (worse performance)
Parameters:      +148% overhead
```

## üéØ Corrected Research Status

| Aspect | Previous Claim | Actual Result | Status |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Performance | "24x better" | 0.6% worse | ‚ùå Unsubstantiated |
| Parameters | "Approaching efficiency" | 2.48x more | ‚ùå Inefficient |
| Theory | "Validated" | Unproven | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs more research |
| Implementation | Works | Works | ‚úÖ Confirmed |

## üî¨ What This Means

### For the Theory
- **Not disproven**, but **not validated** either
- May require much longer training (500+ epochs)
- Might need different architectural approaches
- Could work on different tasks or with better tuning

### For the Research
- This is **normal scientific process** - test, learn, refine
- Better to find limitations now than after publication
- Demonstrates importance of proper validation methodology
- Opens questions about optimal embedding strategies

## üöÄ Future Research Directions

### Immediate Tests Needed
1. **Extended Training**: 500-1000 epochs to see if benefits emerge
2. **Real Language Tasks**: Actual language modeling, not synthetic
3. **Architecture Variants**: Different dimension ratios and allocation strategies
4. **Comparison Studies**: Against other embedding optimization methods

### Longer-term Questions  
1. Do bespoke embeddings work on different model architectures?
2. Are there specific tasks where frequency-based allocation helps?
3. What's the optimal training regime for this approach?
4. How do results compare on real-world language data?

## üìä Repository Files Status

### ‚úÖ Still Valid
- `run_mps_topk_mlp_fixed.py` - Sparse attention research (separate validation)
- Implementation code - Technical implementations work correctly
- Experimental framework - Good foundation for continued research

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Correction
- README claims about "24x better performance" 
- BESPOKE_RESEARCH.md performance claims
- Any documentation suggesting validated benefits

### üî¨ New Additions
- `focused_convergence_test.py` - Honest validation with proper training
- This correction document
- Proper experimental results with realistic training

## üéØ Lessons Learned

### For Future Research
1. **Always train to convergence** before making performance claims
2. **Use realistic training regimes** from the start
3. **Be skeptical of early positive results** - they might be noise
4. **Document negative results** - they're scientifically valuable

### For the Field
1. **Embedding optimization is hard** - simple ideas don't always work
2. **Proper baselines matter** - need adequate training for fair comparison
3. **Publication pressure** can lead to premature claims
4. **Replication and validation** are essential

## ‚úÖ Scientific Integrity Statement

We commit to:
- **Honest reporting** of all results, positive and negative
- **Proper validation** before making performance claims  
- **Transparent methodology** with adequate training regimes
- **Continued research** to understand when/if bespoke embeddings work

This correction demonstrates **how science should work** - test rigorously, admit mistakes, learn, and improve.

**Status**: Research ongoing - theory unproven but not abandoned  
**Next**: Extended validation with proper training regimes  
**Lesson**: Always validate with adequate convergence before making claims
